## Running The Game
The main file is called ```TetrisWindowMain.java```. 

There are a few ways to proceed:

1) If a ```\bin``` directory exists, then, in the root directory (the current path should end in ```\TetrisFinalProject```), run the following command:
```java -cp bin Views.TetrisWindowMain```

2) Alternatively, the program should be able to run by compiling the file ```TetrisWindowMain.java```, which is located in the ```\Views``` directory.
